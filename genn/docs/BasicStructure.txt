This file describes the basic structure of genn, and describes how does genn work.



Core of genn is neural cell, which is a class with a input map, output map and an interface works as activation func-
tion. When working, each cell calculate its output value when all input value in position. When calculation is done, it
transport this value to the next cell in output map. In this iteration, the whole calculation completed.
But now, weight and bias tuning is not implied yet, and this step is similar as forward propegation.
